# motile chat example

A basic example on how to utilize motile to react to changes in your database.

## First steps

1. Ramp up the database and the motile server.

```bash
pnpm run server.up
```

2. Prepare the database for the example

```bash
pnpm run db.migrate
```

4. Add a resend api key to your `.env` file.

```bash
RESEND_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

3. Start the example in dev mode.

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

4. Connect to the database and add a user to the users table. You can use any postgres client you want, or you can use drizzle studio which is preinstalled with the project.

```bash
pnpm run studio
```
